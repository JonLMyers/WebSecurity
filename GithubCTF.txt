Current attack vectors: CSRF token, search bar, votes.
Current thoughts: CSRF token is random on each request and is stored in the html which is interesting.  search bar sends params via get request.
This means it is most likely inserted into a query directly

investigate csrf attack by get. Research http://phrack.org/issues/69/12.html
